# Neural-Net
## Neural Network from Scratch

### 1. Basic neural network created using only numpy

Requirements: numpy, pandas, matplotlib

### Steps

1. Read input dataframes from Kaggle (mnist-in-csv)
2. Format the dataframes for ease of matrix operations
3. Convert to numpy arrays
4. Initialize weights and biases for the network
5. Define forward propagation
6. Define backward propagation
7. Define update parameters function
8. Run through the neural network with the training dataset
9. Find training accuracy and perform hyperparameter tuning based on number of iterations and learning rate
10. Test network on test dataset
